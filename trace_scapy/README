		rsvg( to convert svg to png, you can remove that)
		scp ( i have it set up to autoupload to my server

this script will:
	take a list of servers from a file and run it though a scapy traceroute

	it can also ignore the file, and you can manully enter in servers

	right now which ports are hardcoded in

 sudo python2.7 trace.py
